Absolutely, Gaurav. Here's a **4-month roadmap** to target **₹50–70+ LPA roles** using **Golang + Cloud + System Design + Blockchain**. This plan is **tailored to your experience** and assumes you're already skilled in Go and have a base in system/backend engineering.

---

## ✅ Goal: Land ₹50–70+ LPA role

### Target Companies:

* Fintech startups (e.g., Zerodha, CoinDCX)
* Web3 firms (e.g., Polygon, Chainalysis)
* Global SaaS/backend infra firms (e.g., Rippling, Stripe, Coinbase, Google Cloud)

---

## 🗓️ Month 1: **Cloud-Native Go & Kubernetes**

### 🎯 Focus:

* Solidify Go for infra-level work
* Gain production-ready Kubernetes & Docker skills

### 📚 Topics:

* Go concurrency, context, interfaces, error wrapping, channels
* REST/gRPC with Go (use `go-grpc`, `mux`, `echo`)
* Dockerize a Go service
* Write Helm charts
* Create production-like Kubernetes deployments (GKE, Minikube)

### 📦 Projects:

* Build a microservice that:

  * Exposes gRPC & REST endpoints
  * Stores data in PostgreSQL/Redis
  * Deploys to K8s with autoscaling

### 🛠 Tools:

* Docker, Helm, Skaffold
* Kubernetes (Minikube/GKE)
* Prometheus + Grafana for metrics
* GitHub Actions for CI

---

## 🗓️ Month 2: **Distributed Systems + System Design**

### 🎯 Focus:

* Prepare for backend architect/system design interviews
* Master scaling patterns & distributed concepts

### 📚 Topics:

* Load balancing, caching (CDN, Redis)
* Database sharding, indexing, transactions
* Event-driven architecture, Kafka
* CAP theorem, consistency models
* Horizontal scaling, fault tolerance
* API gateway, rate limiting

### 📘 Resources:

* [System Design Primer GitHub](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer)
* Grokking System Design + mock interviews
* YouTube: Hussein Nasser, Tech Dummies Narayan

### 🛠 Project:

* Build a “YouTube Lite” system with:

  * Video metadata service
  * Upload service
  * CDN layer simulation
  * Redis caching
  * Kafka-based async processing

---

## 🗓️ Month 3: **Blockchain & Web3 with Golang**

### 🎯 Focus:

* Add blockchain execution, smart contract interfacing
* Optional: Use your Kalp SDK experience

### 📚 Topics:

* Ethereum architecture (EVM, gas, ABI)
* Smart contracts (ERC-20, ERC-1155)
* Go-Ethereum (geth), `go-ethereum/accounts/abi/bind`
* How to sign & send transactions from Go
* Interacting with Infura, Alchemy

### 🔨 Project:

* Go-based dApp backend:

  * User connects wallet
  * Sends transaction (ERC-20 transfer)
  * Verifies via Etherscan API
  * Logs events

---

## 🗓️ Month 4: **Interview Prep + Job Applications**

### 🎯 Focus:

* Polish resume
* Crack interviews with live problem-solving

### 📚 Activities:

* LeetCode NeetCode150 (focus on 2-pointer, heap, sliding window, DP)
* Low-level Go coding (goroutines, channels, mutex problems)
* Mock 2 system design interviews/week
* Prepare STAR-format stories (projects, leadership, failures)

### 🎯 Apply to:

* Global remote companies via:

  * **Wellfound (AngelList)**
  * **RemoteOK, Turing, Deel, Arc.dev**
* Top Indian companies via:

  * **Naukri Premium, LinkedIn Easy Apply**
  * **Referrals through ex-colleagues or GitHub connections**

---

## 📄 Bonus: Resume & LinkedIn Tips

* Showcase **Kubernetes, Golang, Web3, Cloud-native** keywords
* Include links to GitHub repos and real deployment URLs
* Example headline:

  > “Golang Backend Engineer | Kubernetes | Web3 | Ex-MNC | 8 YOE | Open to Remote & India | Targeting ₹60–70 LPA+ Roles”
