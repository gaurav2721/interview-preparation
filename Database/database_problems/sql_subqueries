Subquery 
1. If there is a sql query nested in another sql query , usually there is a outer query and inner query .[outer means 
it comes after select , outer query is after where ]
2. used with CRUD statements for eg select , insert , update, delete for eg select colName,<sub_query> from tableName 
3. it can be used with where select * from tableName where <sub_query>
4. it can be used with 'from' for eg select * from <sub_query> as altName;

for eg 
find all the employees having salary greater than current min salary

to find min salary subquery is -> select min(salary) from employee
to find all the employees -> select name,salary from employee where salary > (subquery) 
    select name,salary from employee where salary > (select min(salary) from employee)
    there is another way to do it which is to use alias
    select min(age) as min_age from employee -> subquery 
    select emp.name from employee emp , (<sub_query>) as subquery where emp.age > subquery.min_age;
    select (select min(age) from employees) as avg_age,age from employee


------------------->
Outer sub query can be used with where clause

SELECT 
  max_table.max_salary AS maximum,
  COUNT(e.employee_id) AS employee_count
FROM 
  employee e
JOIN 
  (SELECT MAX(salary * months) AS max_salary FROM employee) AS max_table
ON 
  e.salary * e.months = max_table.max_salary;
