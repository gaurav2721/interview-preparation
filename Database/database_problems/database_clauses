sql clauses - clauses basically mean conditions
as - this basically is used to establish alias

where - filters the rows based on certain conditions
limit - limit the number of rows returned in a query -> select * from student limit 2;

order by - provides the record in ascending and descending order -> select * from student order by class desc; -> default is ascending 
you can sort on the basis of 2 parameters are provided like this 
elect name from students where marks>75 order by substr(name,-3,3),id;

select city,length(city) as l from station group by city,length(city) order by length(city),city limit 1;
select city,length(city) as l from station group by city,length(city) order by length(city) desc,city limit 1;

group by - basically indicates on which group the aggregation will by applied

difference between having and where ?
where command is applied to filter rows based on the condition ,before aggregation -> where is used with select , update and delete 
for eg select * from <table_name> where <condition>
where as having is applied to filter rows based on the condition after aggregating -> having is generally used with group by and aggregator clauses
select <col1> <col2> agg(col3) from <table_name> groupby <col1> <col2> having condition;

for eg , write a query to provide number of employees in each city
select city,count(name) as number from student group by city

for eg write a query to display the department names along side the total count of employees in each department, sorting the results by total 
count of employees in descending order

select department,count(no_of_employees) as count_employees from employees group by department order by count_employees desc;

for eg write a query to list the departments where the average salary is greater than 1200 and also display salary name and average salary
select department,avg(salary) as emp_salary from employee group by department having emp_salary>1200 order by emp_salary desc;
