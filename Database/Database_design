Name the database starting with _
1. Come up with entity
2. Make sure to split the data so that redendant data is not there 
3. Make sure that each column is storing only one information
4. Make sure that the primary key does not contain any business data 
5. Make sure to create database constraint , primary key , unique key and foreign key 



One to one relationship -> Primary key to unique foreign key constraint

Data Model -> How data is structured within a database 
    -> what are the entities , attributes , constraints 
    -> schema is the implementation using a data model

There are different type of models 
    -> Entity relationship data models are very important from the perspective of data models

1. Heirarchial Data Model
    -> this resembles tree structure ,each record maintains a parent child relationship for eg xml

2.    Network Data Model    
    -> this resembles graph , each record can have multiple parent and multiple child

3. Relational Data models
    -> Tables are organized in the form of columns/attributes and rows/tuple

4. Entity Relationship model : multiple entities(which have attributes) , relationship is basically how these entities are related to one another 

5. Object Oriented Data Model : Models depicts data as object on which all the principles of OOPS apply i.e abstraction , encapsulation ,
    inheritance , polymorphism
