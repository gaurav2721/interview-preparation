// Consistency : if you ping any node , it will return the most successfull recent write 
// Availability : whenever you ping any node , it will give you some response within the timeframe specified in the service level agreement
// usually when there is a single source of truth ,then consistency is high .
// whenever you have parallelism or concurrency you have to choose between consistency and availability
