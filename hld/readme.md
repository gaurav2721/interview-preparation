Companies usually ask questions based on two patterns 
- either they ask problems that they can cover within 1 hour 
- or they will ask a part of a complex app 
- completing the whole complex app is usually not there but can be there depending on the interviewer
- or they can give the problem based on what they are doing right then

Few commonly asked questions for hld:
- BookMyShow
- Design Fastag 
- Design Upi
- Design DB Layer
- Design MakeMyTrip

Few of the theoretical questions are :
- difference between authentication and authorization explain with examples 
- what are acid and base properties 
- what is cap theorm 
- difference between eventual consistency and strong consistency 

How people are judged 
- communication
    - Always speak slow and say out loud what you are thinking 
    - Ability to listen is judged , reiterate the things that you want to confirm on 
    - Always be honest and say if you are taking a guess 

- Problem Solving 
    - Ability to analyse an open ended problem and vague problems
    - Come up with goals and constraints , bottlenecks of the system design problem  
    - Ability to solve problem in a systemic manner that is step by step
