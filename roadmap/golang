## 🎁 Bonus Tips to Maximize Your Job Chances

* 📬 **Cold Email Template**:

  > *"Hi \[Name], I’ve been building distributed systems in Go and recently completed \[project]. I’d love to contribute to \[company]’s backend infra. Could we connect or chat briefly if you’re hiring?"*

* 📈 Focus on **startups**, **Web3**, **Fintech**, **infrastructure tools** — they pay well and value Go skills highly.

* 🧠 If asked: "Why Go?" → Talk about simplicity, built-in concurrency, fast compile times, and great tooling for scalable backends.

---

Would you like help with:

* Resume polish?
* Project README example?
* 20 high-quality companies/startups to target?

I can deliver that next.



Great — since your goal is a ₹70 LPA+ job switch, the Month 4 focus should be laser-targeted toward **backend system design**, **infra-level projects**, and **interview-readiness** for product companies, fintechs, and Web3 startups.

---

## 🚀 Month 4 (Updated for ₹70 LPA+ Target)

### Week 13–14: **System Design with Go**

> Master high-scale backend architecture + Go profiling

* Read:

  * [Designing Data-Intensive Applications (DDIA)](https://dataintensive.net) – skim key chapters
  * ByteByteGo YouTube (common system design patterns)

* Practice design questions:

  * Design URL shortener
  * Design rate limiter (sliding window in Go)
  * Design distributed cron job scheduler

✅ **Implement in Go:**

* In-memory cache with TTL & LRU
* Rate limiter using channels and `time.Ticker`
* Task scheduler using `cron`, `context`, and persistence (Postgres)

---

### Week 15: **Portfolio Project (Infra-focused)**

> Build a real-world backend that shows scale + concurrency

### 🔧 Pick one (based on your strength):

1. **Distributed Workflow Engine (like Temporal-lite)**

   * Use: Go + PostgreSQL + goroutines
   * Features: chained jobs, retries, error handling, logs
   * Add: REST API + dashboard for status

2. **Event-Driven Payment Processor**

   * Components: event queue (Redis or NATS), worker pool, persistence
   * Add: retry logic, dead letter queue, metrics

3. **Web3 Gasless Transaction Service**

   * Use: Go + Ethereum JSON-RPC + Redis + PostgreSQL
   * Functions: transaction bundler, replay detection, signature verification

---

### Week 16: **Polish + Job Prep**

> Package your skills for recruiters & interviews

* Final polish on projects:

  * Add README, Swagger, Makefile, CI/CD YAML, Dockerfile
  * Host it on GitHub + deploy to Render/Fly.io

* Resume building:

  * Highlight concurrency, infra, scale, profiling, custom caching, etc.
  * Add metrics like "Handled 10k+ concurrent job executions with < 200ms latency"

* Interview prep:

  * DSA: Grokking + NeetCode top 75
  * System Design: Low-level + High-level (use Go in explanation)
  * Backend-specific: race conditions, sync primitives, API versioning, DB indexing
