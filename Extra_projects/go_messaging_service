This project should be built on GoLong

We expect an Individual or team to build the API according to our program structure

The Project is to Send, Record Messages and Calculate the Cost of it. 

For Sending Messages, We will be using the following Communication medium, and the developer is supposed to implement it 

1. Email
2. SMS (It should be flexible enough to choose the provider)
3. WhatsApp 
4. Telegram
5. Line App

The API should be written in the most generic way to accept the messages and it can send in multiple communication medium 

We should also record how many messages are sent by the tenant, what messages are sent, delivered, and read receipt of the message, etc 

It should also record whether it should be chargeable to the tenant and its price based on the tenant's details
