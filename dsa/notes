Following is the quick strategy that you can implement to clear DSA rounds 

1. Repeat the problem
2. Ask Clarifying questions and cover edge cases
3. Check for input output , check the constraints
4. Tell your approach(if you are stuck , you can say hmm that is interesting I am sort of blocked here, could you help me out) , then ask the interviewer if you can start to write the code 
5. Tell them you will improve readability later(by renaming variables , divide into various functions, implement design patterns , usually when you are asked Leetcode easy problem they might expect that) , while writing the code , keep the interviewer engaged as to what you are doing 
6. Run it by testcases 
7. Think about space and time complexity
8. You can atleast return the sample values provided
9. You are judged on the following parameters : Algorithm , Coding , Communication , Problem Solving
10. You can specifically ask if that answers your questions
11. Even ask them if you can google  
12. In the end thank them for giving the opportunity and ask them about the tech stack they are using
