1. Recursion , two pointer and three pointer approach , for eg the one used in reversing the linked list is important to see 
2. Using Hashmaps and multiple iteration
3. Floyd marshal algorithm , of having fast and slow pointer , lets you detect the cycle and if you want to check where that cycle
    is getting formed reset slow pointer to initial pointer and then increment fast and slow pointer one by one
