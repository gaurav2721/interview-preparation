1. you can have two pointers normal iteration,lengthWise, front and back , sliding and two arrays
2. starting sliding window with 0,0 and 0,1 , also it is important to know if todo end++ operation in the beginning or at the last , look at minimum window substring
3. Sliding can be of two type kadane or sliding that is "Longest Repeating Character Replacement which is derived from kadane itself"


maxSoFar=nums[0]
currSum=0 // currSum=0 indicates no element is There

for _,num:=range nums{
    if currSum<0{
		currSum=0 // this means the start is reset
	}
	currSum+=num
	if maxSoFar<currSum{
		maxSoFar=currSum // here the end is incremented
	}
}
return maxSoFar
