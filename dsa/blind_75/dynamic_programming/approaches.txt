Dynamic Programming 
You can assign 2-D array ,iterate using i,j,l which is length of sub array /sub sequence , longest common subsequece is a good scenario
You can assign a 2 single dimensional array , iterate from forward and backward , have a length of 1,2
You can have length of 2d or 1d array as n or n+1
There can also be a scenario where dp approach is O(1)


If you can break the problem into recursion then you can have the db store each state
Also once you have cracked the recursion code then check 
There can be an algorithm for coming up of with a function that can setup the values as well 



Bottom up 
1. build the problem from the simplest scenario
2. f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)
