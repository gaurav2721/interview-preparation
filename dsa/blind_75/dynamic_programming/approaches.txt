Dynamic Programming 
You can assign 2-D array 
You can assign a 2 single dimensional array , iterate from forward and backward 
You can have length of 2d or 1d array as n or n+1

If you can break the problem into recursion then you can have the db store each state

Bottom up 
1. build the problem from the simplest scenario
2. f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)
