Graph is collection of vertices and edges (v,e)

For an undirected/directed graph use an adjacency list / adjacency matrix

Assuming all the val of nodes are unique

type Node struct{
    val int,
    edges map[int]bool
}

type Graph map[int]*Node

For a undirected/directed graph with weights

type Graph map[int]*Node

type Node struct{
    val int
    edges map[int]*Edges
}

type Edges struct{
    weight int
    destination_node *Node
}
