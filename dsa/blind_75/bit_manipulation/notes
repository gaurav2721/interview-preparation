Golang functionality
1. when >>,<< operator is used with & or | that is bitwise AND and bitwise OR operator you can get to know the sum of two int without by finding the common thing by taking add <<1 to mutiply by two and then a=a^b to find out what is different and keep repeating loop till similar portion is zero 
2. In XOR ,same values return in zero
3. >>1 is similar to getting divided by 2 

Libraries to remember 
"math/bits"
- “OnesCount” , gives you the number of bits which are there
- Logb
- Pow(a,b) for a^b
- math.MaxInt32 - 214 748 364 7
- math.MinInt32 - 214 748 364 8

Algorithms 
1. LCM*HCF = a*b
2. to find HCF (find smaller of a,b and then lets say b is the bigger number calculate b%a then again call the hcf function with b%a and a)
2. To find the prime number from 2 to root of n we have to check if it is divisible by that number 


Tricks to remember 
1. missing number = n(n+1)/2 - sum
