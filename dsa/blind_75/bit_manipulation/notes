Golang functionality
1. when >>,<< operator is used with & or | that is bitwise AND and bitwise OR operator you can get to know the 

Libraries to remember 
"math/bits"
- “OnesCount” , gives you the number of bits which are there
- Logb
- Power

Algorithms 
1. LCM*HCF = a*b
2. to find HCF (find smaller of a,b and then lets say b is the bigger number calculate b%a then again call the hcf function with b%a and a)
2. To find the prime number from 2 to root of n we have to check if it is divisible by that number 


Tricks to remember 
1. missing number = n(n+1)/2 - sum
