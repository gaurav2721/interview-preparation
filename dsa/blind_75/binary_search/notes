1. It is important to learn and remember a basic snippet for each code
2. the condition to choose is something which is tricky refer to search in a rotated sorted array , koko eating bananas
3. take care of edge cases like rotated sorted array 
4. an important thing to remember is the behaviour or sort.Search , it starts from 0 , and tries to return the first index that satisfies the provided condition
