1. In go the map keys can be of primitive type , struct type where member variables are comparable , array types ,pointer types .
    And they cannot be slices , map or function
2. Whenever you are thinking of array -> think about hashmap , sort, search , two pointer ,sliding window, greedy ,recursion backtracking 
3. Increasing space complexity is another approach
4. A lot of the times you should start with brute force as that can work as well for eg valid sudoku
5. How to use the map variable in golang is very important
6. To come up with edge cases use positive , negative , zero , duplicates and extreme scenario such as 0 length , math.IntMax and math.IntMin
