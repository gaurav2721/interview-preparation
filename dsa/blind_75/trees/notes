1. What you have to remember is usually divide and conquer , that is recursion
2. BFS
        (marker for eg and right view and level based approach for eg check binary tree level order traversal ) and 
   DFS
        [pre-order,inorder,post-order, reverse pre, reverse in, reverse post , using a for loop and stack - kth smallest element] for eg , count good nodes 
3. There are layer1 problems and layer2(layer2 problems use layer 1 problems as base) problems , layer3 problems 
    1. For eg depth of binary tree -> diameter of the tree -> binary tree maximum path sum

Special Problems
1. Detecting if a tree is a BST
2. Serializing and deserializing a binary tree

Edge Cases 
1. If the tree is completely skewed
2. Empty or tree of size 1
