1. What you have to remember is usually divide and conquer , that is recursion
2. BFS and DFS[pre-order,inorder,post-order, reverse pre, reverse in, reverse post] for eg , count good nodes 
3. There are layer1 problems and layer2(layer2 problems use layer 1 problems as base) problems , layer3 problems  

Special Problems
1. Detecting if a tree is a BST
2.

Edge Cases 
1. If the tree is completely skewed
2. Empty or tree of size 1
